Hi, this is my practice corner for coding in R. I would want to:

- learn tidyverse
- practice on data visualization, exploration.
- learn tidymodels/machine learning
- work on chemistry related datasets using R
- learn Design of Experiment
- learn Chemometrics
- learn how to analyse sensory data
- be able to communicate insights from data analysis using the Rmarkdown/distill packages
