	abstract = {The objective of this study was to mix beet juice and orange juice in two proportions (1:1 and 1:2 v/v), evaluate their physicochemical stability and antioxidant activity during storage (4 °C for 30 days), and evaluate their acceptance by consumers. Beet juice (with or without pasteurization) and pasteurized orange juice were used as controls. The presence of orange juice contributed to the {pH}, betacyanin, betaxanthin, and antioxidant capacity stabilities during storage, whereas the presence of beet improved the color stability. The mixed juices showed high total phenolic compounds (484–485 µg gallic acid/{mL}), {DPPH} scavenging capacity (2083–1930 µg Trolox/{mL}), and {ABTS} (1854–1840 µg Trolox/{mL}), as well as better sensory acceptance than the pasteurized beet juice. However, the mixed juices had a more significant reduction in the ascorbic acid content (completely lost at 15 days of storage) than the pasteurized orange juice (25\% reduction at 30 days). The beet and orange mixed juice is an alternative functional beverage that can contribute to an increase in the consumption of beet and orange.},

While subjective visual assessment and visual color standards are still used in the food industry, objective instrumental color measurements are extensively employed. This chapter provides a brief description of human physiology of vision and an overview of the different color-ordering and color-measuring systems. Included are the {CIE} tristimulus system and tristimulus colorimeters, with coverage of the Hunter Lab system, the {CIEL}*a*b* system, and the L*C*H* system. Also covered are sample preparation and presentation to get measurements that are repeatable and that correspond to visual appearance. The chapter is limited to presenting the basic underlying principles that allow for an understanding of how color of food products should be measured.},

	abstract = {For purposes of data analysis and data interpretation, it is important to have uniform representation of hue derived from the Hunter L, a, b color space. Using the standard calculation for hue [Arc tan (b/a)], positive signed results are generated for the first quadrant [+a, +b] only. The other quadrants should be handled so that a 360° representation is accommodated and results are expressed as positive signed numbers. Second quadrant [-a, +b] and third quadrant [−a, −b] calculations should be: hue = 180+Arc tan(b/a). Fourth quadrant [+a, −b] calculations should be: hue = 360+ Arc tan(b/a). Furthermore when planning statistical analysis of data which transverse the {IV} and I quadrant, tranformations of the data will continue increasing in hue angle from 361° on up as high as appropriate. A spreadsheet macro for achieving these results can be easily derived.},

	shorttitle = {Biosynthesis of plant pigments},
	abstract = {Plant compounds that are perceived by humans to have color are generally referred to as ‘pigments’. Their varied structures and colors have long fascinated chemists and biologists, who have examined their chemical and physical properties, their mode of synthesis, and their physiological and ecological roles. Plant pigments also have a long history of use by humans. The major classes of plant pigments, with the exception of the chlorophylls, are reviewed here. Anthocyanins, a class of flavonoids derived ultimately from phenylalanine, are water-soluble, synthesized in the cytosol, and localized in vacuoles. They provide a wide range of colors ranging from orange/red to violet/blue. In addition to various modifications to their structures, their specific color also depends on co-pigments, metal ions and {pH}. They are widely distributed in the plant kingdom. The lipid-soluble, yellow-to-red carotenoids, a subclass of terpenoids, are also distributed ubiquitously in plants. They are synthesized in chloroplasts and are essential to the integrity of the photosynthetic apparatus. Betalains, also conferring yellow-to-red colors, are nitrogen-containing water-soluble compounds derived from tyrosine that are found only in a limited number of plant lineages. In contrast to anthocyanins and carotenoids, the biosynthetic pathway of betalains is only partially understood. All three classes of pigments act as visible signals to attract insects, birds and animals for pollination and seed dispersal. They also protect plants from damage caused by {UV} and visible light.},
