This is a glossary of terms, in alphabetical order.

- Correlation, *r* : whether there is any relationship between two variables. If so, whether the relationship is weak or strong, and what the direction of relationship is.

- Principal Component Analysis (PCA): a multivariate technique used to reduce the number of dimensions to explain the total variation in the data with a few linear combinations of original variables, which are uncorrelated. 

- Variance, *SË†2*: the average of squared deviations of the values from mean. Square root of variance = standard deviation.
