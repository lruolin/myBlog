	abstract = {This popular textbook gives a clear account of the principles of the main statistical methods used in modern analytical laboratories. Such methods underpin high quality analyses in areas such as the safety of food, water and medicines, environmental monitoring, and chemical manufacturing. The treatment throughout emphasises the underlying statistical ideas, and no detailed knowledge of mathematics is required. There are numerous worked examples, including the use of Microsoft Excel and Minitab, and a large number of student exercises, many of them based on examples from the analytical literature.Key features expanded treatment of control charts additions to cover single point calibration and method comparison techniques extended treatment of robust methods major additions to sections on multivariate regression numerous worked examples, using Microsoft Excel and Minitab an attractive two-colour text design updated Instructors' manual improved website including examples for lecturers and students This book is aimed at undergraduate and graduate courses in Analytical Chemistry and related topics. It will also be a valuable resource for researchers and chemists working in analytical chemistry.Professor James Miller is Emeritus Professor of Analytical Chemistry at Loughborough University. He has published numerous reviews and papers on analytical techniques and been awarded the {SAC} Silver Medal, the Theophilus Redwood Lectureship and the {SAC} Gold Medal by the Royal Society of Chemsitry. A Past President of the Analytical Division of the {RSC}, he is a member of the Society's Council and has served on the editorial boards of many analytical and spectroscopic journals.Dr Jane Miller completed a {PhD} at Cambridge University's Cavendish Laboratory and is an experienced teacher of mathematics and physics at higher education and 6th form levels. She holds an {MSc} in Applied Statistics and is the author of several specialist A-level statistics texts.},
