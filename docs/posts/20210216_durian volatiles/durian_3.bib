	abstract = {Headspace solid phase microextraction ({SPME}) coupled to fast gas chromatography-mass spectrometry ({GC}-{MS}) was applied to analyze the volatile compounds of durian (Durio zibethinus) varieties D2, D24, and D101 from Malaysia. Sampling sensitivity was improved by evaluation of sample matrix, sampling size, headspace volume, salt addition and sampling duration. A total of 39 volatile compounds were identified including 22 esters, 9 sulphur-containing alkanes, 3 thioacetals, 2 thioesters, 2 thiolanes and 1 alcohol. The relative amount of volatiles estimated using 1ppm internal standard ({IS}) revealed the differences in the volatile composition among varieties. Further classification and characterization of each durian variety was successfully conducted using principal component analysis ({PCA}).},

	abstract = {A series of branched esters (methyl 2,2-dimethylpropanoate to ethyl 2-ethylhexanoate) were purified by preparative gas chromatography and their odor thresholds were determined using sensory panel methods. The odor thresholds reached a minimum with the butanoate and pentanoate esters. In general, the branched esters have much lower odor thresholds than their straight chain counterparts. Replacing methyl and ethyl branch substituents with mercapto- or hydroxy-groups resulted in higher odor thresholds.},
