  Hi, this is my practice corner for coding in R.

```{r setup, include=FALSE}
knitr::opts_chunk$set(echo = FALSE)
```

About this blog: a place to code and build portfolio.
About me: food scientist, used to analyse data with Excel and SPSS before I met R. Attended a short modular course on R and want to build and expand on what I have learnt. 

*Aristotle â€” 'The more you know, the more you know you don't know.'*

and that makes me want to learn even more.
