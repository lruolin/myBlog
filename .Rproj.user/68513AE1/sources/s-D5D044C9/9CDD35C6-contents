```{r setup, include=FALSE}
knitr::opts_chunk$set(echo = FALSE)
```

Why do I want to learn R?

- It is more efficient as compared to Excel in terms of structuring data
- The visualizations can be customized and are gorgeous
- The possibilities are endless: webscraping, machine learning
- It cuts across many different domains: psychology, natural sciences, politics
- My teachers for R have been inspiring and I want to build on what they have taught.
